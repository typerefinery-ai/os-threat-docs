# Creating the OS-Triage Prototype

The Prototype contains a series of API's, 3 CMS pages and forms:
1. **"API Middleware"**: API's used to support the prototype
2. **"All Incidents Table"**: Developed 100% with built-in widgets
3. **"Incident Overview"**: Combines built-in widgets and forms with a simple (only a few events) iFrame
4. **"Incident Details"**: Combines built-in widgets with a sophsiticated iFrame
5. **"Stix Forms"**: Specialised form behaviour for Stix

These are described in the following pages.


**TO-DO:** Extend this to include screenshots of:*
- *starting a new page with a tabbed section*
- *filling out the tabs, and*
- *creating each new page*
